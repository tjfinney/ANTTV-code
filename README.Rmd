# ANTTV

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

ANTTV is a package of *R* programs for analysing data on New Testament textual variation. [How to discover textual groups](https://www.tfinney.net/Groups/index.xhtml) provides an introduction to the techniques involved.

To get started:

1. Install *R* on your computer
2. [Optional] To make life far easier, install RStudio on your computer
3. Install the ANTTV package
4. Use the programs in the package to analyse the data.

## Installation

Once *R* is installed, you can install the development version of ANTTV from [GitHub](https://github.com/) by entering the following commands at the *R* prompt:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tjfinney/ANTTV")
```

## Nomenclature

A data matrix specifies the textual state of each witness (e.g. manuscript, lectionary, version, Church Father) at a series of variation sites (i.e. places where the texts differ). Each data matrix has as many rows as witnesses and as many columns as variation sites. Cells of the matrix contain symbols (typically numerals) that represent the textual states of the witnesses at the variation sites. If the state of a witness is not known at a particular site then the symbol `NA` is entered to indicate that this datum is *not available*.

A distance matrix records the *simple matching distance* (SMD) between each possible pairing of witnesses in a data matrix. Given two witnesses whose textual states are known at a series of variation sites, the SMD is the number of sites at which their states differ divided by the number of variation sites compared. A pairing of witnesses is not compared at sites where the textual state of either witness is not known, as indicated by the symbol `NA` in the data matrix. The SMD ranges from a minimum of zero to a maximum of one: 0 represents perfect agreement (all compared textual states are the same) and 1 represents perfect disagreement (all compared textual states differ). The distance matrix is square, with a column and row for each witness. If rows and columns have the same ordering then the diagonal is comprised entirely of zeroes because each witness is a distance of zero from itself.

## Data sets

Built-in data sets include:

Mark.UBS4
: A data matrix comprised of 267 rows of observations (i.e. witnesses listed in the apparatus of Mark's Gospel in the 4th ed. of the UBS *Greek New Testament*) and 142 variables (i.e. variation sites listed in the same apparatus).

Acts.UBS2.dist
: A distance matrix constructed from tables of percentage agreement that were compiled from the apparatus of the second edition of the UBS *Greek New Testament* by Maurice A. Robinson. 

Numerous other New Testament data sets are available from the [Zenodo repository](https://zenodo.org/). (Try searching for *Finney, Tim* to find them.) Some are data matrices (showing textual states of witnesses) and others are distance matrices (showing distances between pairs of witnesses calculated with the simple matching distance).

## Functions

`read_data_frame()`
: Makes a data frame from a comma-separated vector (CSV) file.

`read_dist_matrix()`
: Reads a distance matrix from a comma-separated vector (CSV) file.

`do_reduction()`
: Drops witnesses from a data matrix until the number of variation sites that can be compared for each possible pairing of witnesses reaches a minimum tolerable number. This function is used to prevent accidental agreements skewing analysis results. The default value of the minimum tolerable number is fifteen. Using smaller values increases the statistical uncertainties associated with calculated distances. (The chance of the calculated distance being a poor indication of the actual value increases as the number of variation sites compared decreases.) 

`do_CMDS()`
: Perform classical multi-dimensional scaling.

`do_DC()`
: Perform divisive clustering.

`do_NJ()`
: Perform neighbour-joining.

`do_PAM()`
: Perform partitioning around medoids.

## Function chains

Analysis is performed by stringing together a chain of functions using the `|>` pipe operator:

```
## input data frame, do data reduction, do distance matrix, do neighbour-joining analysis
Mark.UBS4 |> do_reduction() |> do_dist() |> do_NJ()
```

or, to obtain the same result from the same data stored at the Zenodo repository, 

```
read_data_frame("https://zenodo.org/record/6466262/files/Mark.UBS4.csv") |> do_reduction() |> do_dist() |> do_NJ()
```

`do_dist()` calculates the distance between each possible pairing of witnesses in the data matrix. pair of The uncertainty in the distance between two witnesses bywitness survives at only a few variation sites then the uncertainty`do_reduction()` 

To analyse a distance matrix,

```
Acts.UBS2.dist |> do_NJ()
```

or, using the same distance matrix from the repository,

```
read_dist_matrix("https://zenodo.org/record/6505843/files/Acts.UBS2.dist.csv") |> do_NJ()
```

Different types of analysis results are obtained by varying the final step. E.g.

```
Mark.UBS4 |> do_reduction() |> do_dist() |> do_CMDS()
```

or

```
Mark.UBS4 |> do_reduction() |> do_dist() |> do_DC()
```

or

```
Mark.UBS4 |> do_reduction() |> do_dist() |> do_PAM()
```

## Keeping a particular witness

Specifying a witness to keep will prevent it being dropped by `do_reduction()` provided that the states of the specified witness are known at a sufficient number of variation sites:

```
Mark.UBS4 |> do_reduction(keep="Origen") |> do_dist() |> do_NJ()
```

or

```
Mark.UBS4 |> do_reduction(keep="P45") |> do_dist() |> do_NJ()
```

The minimum number of variation sites required to calculate a distance can be varied from the default value of 15:

```
Mark.UBS4 |> do_reduction(n=6, keep="P88") |> do_dist() |> do_NJ()
```

Please be aware that reducing the minimum number also reduces the reliability of the analysis results.

To obtain numbers of variation sites at which the states of witnesses in a data matrix are known:

```
rowSums(!is.na(read_data_frame("https://zenodo.org/record/6466262/files/Mark.UBS4.csv")))
```

## Saving results

Analysis results from `do_CMDS()`, `do_DC()`, `do_NJ()`, or `do_PAM()` can be saved by setting the *write* flag to `TRUE` and specifying an output file:

```
Mark.UBS4 |> do_reduction(keep="Origen") |> do_dist() |> do_PAM(fn="../PAM/Mark.UBS4.Origin.txt", write=TRUE)
```

(In PAM analysis, *ASW* is the *average silhouette width*, also known as the *mean silhouette width*, *MSW*. Peaks in *ASW* versus number of groups indicate better groupings.)

A distance matrix can be saved by concluding the function chain with `write.csv()` and specifying an output file:

```
Mark.UBS4 |> do_reduction(keep="Origen") |> do_dist() |> write.csv("../Dist/Mark.UBS4.Origin.dist.csv")
```

## Troubleshooting

Installing the required *ape* and *rgl* packages can be challenging as additional software may need to be installed on your operating system. Details will vary according to your platform (whether Linux, Mac, or Windows). Looking at the package documentation is a good place to start:

* <http://ape-package.ird.fr/ape_installation.html>
* <https://dmurdoch.github.io/rgl/>

The following notes (specific to Ubuntu Linux) might help too. 

### Install ape package

If you hit errors like `/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -llapack: No such file or directory` then try installing `gfortran`, `blas`, and `lapack` with `sudo apt install gfortran libblas-dev liblapack-dev`.

### Install software for do_CMDS()

`do_CMDS()` didn't work with the default `rgl` installation. The following steps were required to get it working:

1. Install OpenGL support (on Linux): `sudo apt install libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev`
2. Install dev version of `rgl` package in RStudio: `remotes::install_github("dmurdoch/rgl")`
3. Install Magick++ (on Linux): `sudo apt install libmagick++-dev`
4. Install `magick` package in RStudio: `install.packages("magick")`
5. Install ImageMagick (on Linux): `sudo apt install imagemagick`
