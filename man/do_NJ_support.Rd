\usage{
do_NJ_support(fr, write = FALSE, fn = "output/NJ/support.png")
}
\arguments{
\item{fr}{A data frame.}

\item{write}{logical flag: (default = FALSE) if TRUE then a plot will be written to file fn.}

\item{fn}{a connection or character string naming the file to write to.}
}
\value{
An object of class "phylo".

\description{
This uses bootstrap sampling of a data frame to produce a neighbour-joining tree with support values. Function do_reduction() is used with its default settings to reduce missing data in the input data frame. (It doesn't matter if the input data frame is already reduced.) Functions do_dist() and do_NJ() are used to produce 100 NJ trees from the reduced data frame. Support values are obtained from these trees.
